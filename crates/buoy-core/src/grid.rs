/// The switching threshold (set to 0.0 here) determines when grid cells switch.
/// A non-zero threshold creates a "buffer zone" around cell boundaries to prevent
/// rapid switching when objects oscillate near the edge. For example:

/// ```text
/// Cell 1          |          Cell 2
///                 |
///         <--ðŸš€-->|   (threshold = 0.0)

///     [===buffer zone===]   (threshold > 0.0)
/// ```
///
/// With threshold = 0.0, the object triggers an immediate cell switch when crossing
/// the boundary. A positive threshold allows some movement past the boundary before
/// switching, preventing jitter for objects that frequently cross cell edges.
