//! Grid system for managing spatial organization and fluid volumes in the simulation.
//!
//! This module implements a hierarchical grid system using BigSpace for large-scale
//! simulations. The root grid contains the entire world, while child grids can be
//! used for specific volumes like atmospheres or oceans.
//!
//! Use child grids to specify large environment volumes, like atmosphere or ocean.
//! New spatial entities should be spawned with their own local grids.
//! Objects can move across environment boundaries so long as they are related
//! along the same branch of the hierarchy.
//!
//! The switching threshold (set to 0.0 here) determines when grid cells switch.
//! A non-zero threshold creates a "buffer zone" around cell boundaries to prevent
//! rapid switching when objects oscillate near the edge. For example:
//!
//! ```text
//! Cell 1          |          Cell 2
//!                 |
//!         <--ðŸš€-->|   (threshold = 0.0)
//!                 |
//!     [===buffer zone===]   (threshold > 0.0)
//! ```
//!
//! With threshold = 0.0, the object triggers an immediate cell switch when crossing
//! the boundary. A positive threshold allows some movement past the boundary before
//! switching, preventing jitter for objects that frequently cross cell edges.
