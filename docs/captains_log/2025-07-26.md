# 2025-07-26

- Moved `controls` to the `buoy-ui` crate.
- Added a new config `scenario.ron` to set up the initial scene.
  - Required new dependencies: `serde`, `bevy_common_assets`, `ron`.
  - I made some placeholder code for the `GasPropertiesConfig` struct, which
    will be used to set up gas properties from the config file.
  - Removed the `scene` module from `buoy-runtime`.
- Removed lots of experimental UI code from `buoy-ui`.

To speed up the physics development, I have taken steps to make the runtime
usable from the terminal (headless mode), like adding in some support for
loading data from config files.

I would like the runtime in headless mode to have a TUI that shows stats
updating in real time, like the update speed, current values of forces, etc. in
a panel that refreshes, rather than just printing new lines to the terminal. A
REPL would be nice to maintain interactive control of the simulation, even in
headless mode.

A TUI and REPL are not required for the simulation to work, but they would help
debugging and development. I am going to vibe code the basics of a TUI and REPL
in the `buoy-runtime` crate before going back to the physics code.

- Added a REPL to the runtime (vibe coded) with a simple command to exit the
  simulation.
- Added a `ConsolePlugin` to the runtime that includes the REPL and TUI.
